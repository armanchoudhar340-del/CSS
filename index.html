                    <p>Leonardo was born in Vinci, in the region of Florence, Italy. He was the out-of-wedlock son of

                        Florentine painter Andrea del Verrocchio.</p>
                    <p>Much of his professional life was spent in the service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan. He later
